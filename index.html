			<h2>Reflection on Web proposal Mockup</h2>
		<p>
In my    <a class="cta" href="proposal.html">Web proposal</a>, I created a web mockup of the Starlight Chilren's Foudation, focussing on the Volunteer component, because after researching on their original website, I realised that their website design does not match their main belief. <br>
After receiving feedback from my tutor, which stated: 
<ul>
  <li>The purpose of each navigation bar is unclear</li>
  <li>There is also some inconsistency in the text sizes and alignment</li>
  <li>Aim for a consistent look and feel which will give the pages some structure and make them easier to read.</li>
</ul>

	<h2>Mind maps</h2>
		<p>I have created two mind maps (shown below) before I started building the website. This helped me to gain a clear idea of what I wanted to include in my website, and what content to include in each page. </p>

<img src="img/home.png" alt=""home"  width="15%"> <figcaption> (Final prototype Home page )</figcaption>
</figure> </center>
	<p>
      Accordingly to the feedback, I made the following changes: 
        <ul>
         <li>I changed the strcuture / framework of the web, becuase the structure was unclear and confusing in my mockups. The navigation bar has been simplified into just three buttons: home, about us and donate. A contact button was added on the top right hand corner. And the volunteer button has been implemented in the centre of the home page.  </li>

         <li>I simplified the home page. This is for the ease of reading for users, so that they don't get intimidated by an overloading amount of information at first glimps. </li>
         <li>I changed the position of the volunteer button to the very centre of the home page. This way, users can easily get access to the signup page. </li>
         <li>In my mockup, quite a lot of content were included in the homepage, which in my final prototype I transferred these information in the About Us page.</li> 
         <li>I have added some animation to the buttons to provide a better user experience. See  <a class="cta" href="#buttons">buttons</a> </li>
         <li>Youth-15 to under 25</li></ul>
        </p>

<h2> Buttons</h2>
     
<p>
  In my mockups, the buttons were looking quite plain and boring, and none of them attracted user attention.
Over the course of designing this webpage, I have worked on the CSS file to upgrade user experience. The one thing I noticed that is important is the buttons. Sometimes when i visit other websites, I get confused when the buttons don't response / interact with be when hovered and clicked, therefore I made buttons in my webpage highly interactive. The image below demonstrates the vast change that I have made on the buttons. <br></p>

		<section id="colours">
			<h2>Colours</h2>
			<p>When I first started designing my website, I have set the background-image to be a purple to blue gradient.(shown below)
     </p>

       <figure> <center>
<img src="img/bg1.png" alt=""process"  width="20%"> <figcaption>  1st background iteration</figcaption>
</figure> </center>

<p>However after a few rounds of user testing and asking a couple of my friends' opinions, I have decided to give my website background a more minimalistic look. (shown below)</p>

       <figure> <center>
<img src="img/bg2.png" alt=""process"  width="20%"> <figcaption> 2nd background iteration</figcaption>
</figure> </center>

<p>In my final prototype, I have decided to further modify my background colour in order to match the signature colour palette of the original website. (shown below)</p>

       <figure> <center>
<img src="img/bg3.png" alt=""process"  width="20%"> <figcaption> 3rd background iteration</figcaption>
</figure> </center>
</section>
			

			<h3 id="signup">Sign up forms</h3>
			<p>In my wireframes from the web proposal, the sign up forms looked pretty basic. However, in my final prototype I have decided to edit the css of it in order to make it look more simplistic. Such simplisticity can improve user experiences.</p>

<figure> <center>
<img src="img/oldform.png" alt=""form1",  width="15%"> <figcaption> (Wireframe sign up form) </figcaption>
</figure> </center>
<figure> <center>
<img src="img/newform.png" alt=""form1",  width="15%"> <figcaption> (Final prototype sign up form) </figcaption>
</figure> </center>
<p> As shown above, the modified sign up form looked pretty clean.</p>
