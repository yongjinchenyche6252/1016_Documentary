			<h2>Introduction</h2>
		<p>
This Web Proposal focuses on  creating appropriate website wireframes & mockups for Starlight Children's Foundation by undertaking in-depth research into the organisation and identifying user needs. <br>
After studying though the weibsite of the Starlight, I have came to the understanding that it lacks simplicity, structure and useful information in their 'Volunteer' section. This will be discussed further in this study.

			<p>
        Starlight Children's Foundation is an Australian charity group founded in 1988, who helps:
        <ul>
         <li> Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people</li>
         <li>Children - aged 6 to under 15</li>
         <li>Families</li>
         <li>People with chronic illness</li> 
         <li>People with disabilities</li>
         <li>Youth-15 to under 25</li></ul>
        </p>

        <h3>
        Key Activities & Beliefs
        </h3>
        <p>
The Starlight Children's Foundation aims to offer financial help, medical help and psychological guidance to children in difficult situations. The Starlight Children's Foundation firmly believes that psychological and mental health can be in building a healthy personaility and social connection. Their hospitals and programs are based on the principles of positive pychology. 

			<blockquote>
			"Every year Starlight invests more than $20M per year into the public health care to support the total care of children, young people, and their families." (ACNC, 2020)
			</blockquote>

      <h3> Their Website </h3>
        <p>
          The Starlight Children's Foundation website focuses on <strong>Three main components:</strong> 
          <ol>
            <li> Volunteer</li>
            <li> Fundraising </li>
            <li> Donation </li></ol> <br>
        

  
 <h4> Strengths </h4>
<ul>
<li> Catchy colour pallete: Using bright and saturated colours to catch viewers' attention </li>
<li> Playful Fonts </li> 
<li> Appropriate balance between text and images</li>
<li> Appropriate use of contrast between size fonts, sizes and colours to make important informations 'pop'. </li>
</ul> </br>

     <h4> Weaknesses </h4>
     <ul>
       <li>The bright colours and playful texts together makes the website look rather messy and unorganised. </li>
       <li> Loads of information are offfered to readers, however it is difficult to tell what are the most useful information. </li>
       <li> The steps to become a volunteer are unclear and misleading. </li>
       <li> Users need to send an email to the organisation in order to sign up as a volunteer. Which can be quite tedious and frustrating.  </li>
       <li> Limited information are provided regarding the volunteer program, such as where and when.</li>
       <li> A introductive video has been implemented showing the joyfulness and excitement of becoming a volunteer. This inspires users to become a volunteer.
 </ul>

 <h3> Problem area </h3> 
 <p> 
To my surprise, the Starlight Children's Foundation did not emphasise the 'Volunteer' component as much as I have expected since it is an organisation that enforces on the psychological well-being of young generation though certain programs, which requires volunteers. </br>
My website design will thus be based on the Volunteer program of the Starlight Children's Foundation. I aim to design a website that allows people to sign up to become a volunteer <strong>effortlessly</strong> and <strong>quickly </strong>. This is an opportunity to encourage more people to become volunteers, as it overcomes the time-consuming and tedious process to sign up as a volunteer.   </p>

 <!--👩‍💻👩‍💻👩‍💻👩‍💻User Profile👩‍💻👩‍💻👩‍💻👩‍💻‍-->


			<section id="profiles">
<h2> User profile </h2>
     
<p>
I employed questionnaire in my research, because it is a great method to use to gain honest opinions and useful insights from people on the specific topic. It is also a great tool to generate trends and patterns, which I then used to create a user profile. I followed the steps below to create the user profile:
  </p>

<img src="Images/process.png" alt=""process"  width="20%"> <figcaption> (Steps in creating user profile)</figcaption>
</figure> </center>

	<p>
        Accordingly to  statistics and trends that were collected in the <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1E70jdQgMVe0ixRBV3Ly_dOIA3aQdM9kz3WMBXxXPW04/edit#responses"> Questionnaire,  </a> I  created a User Profile which is based on the data collected. The questionnaire is efficient in gaining clear demographcis and user needs. 90% of the participants are aged between 18-24. Only 40% have been involved in previous volunteer activities. To no surprisers, 60% of the participants have stated that they would like to richen their resume while doing charity works. 
      </p>

    <!-- 🌸🌸🌸🌸DEATION🌸🌸🌸🌸-->
		<section id="ideation">
			<h2>Ideation</h2>
			<p>In order to generate an insightful and creative website that counteracts the needs of target users, I have performed the following activities: 

  <ul> 
    <li> Mood Board </li>
    <li> Sketches </li>
   	</ul>
     </p>
			

      <!--😊😊😊😊MoodBoards😊😊😊😊-->
			<h3 id="moodboards">Mood Boards</h3>
			<p>I employed mood boards to visually express my design ideas. It is a flexible method to communicate qualities and values through discussions. In the end of this activity, I have gained a clear understanding of desireable elemetns that I should coorporate into my website.</p>
<figure> <center>
<img src="Images/Moodboard.JPG" alt=""Moodboard",  width="40%"> <figcaption> (Mood board) </figcaption>
</figure> </center>

<h3>Insights</h3>
<p> Through making the mood board, I was able to brainstorm elements and features that I would like to cooporate in my website design, in order to increase usability and improve user experience. I was also able to present the mood board to two of my friends in order to commence a discussion of what they features they think a good website should encompass. Through the discussion, I generated a Mind Map, shown below:

			<h3 id="sketches">Sketches</h3>
			<p>
Sketches of the website are done based with<strong> Three main subjects</strong> in mind: 
<ol>
<li> Simple to understand: Familiar UI elements </li>
<li> Efficient </li>
<li> Appropriate balance between playfulness & Reliability</li>
</ol>

			<h2>Designs</h2>
			<p>Based on the background research and user research, I have created five wireframes for both web browsers and mobile phones, representing key elements that I would like to cooporate in my website design. </p>
			<h3 id="wireframes">Wireframes</h3>
			<p>I used Balsamiq to create simple and basic wireframes for my website design. It is an effective tool in creating low-fidelity prototypes, presenting visual aspects and UI elements. </p>

 <h3 id="mockups">Mockups</h3>
      <p>
        Based on the wireframes,I have created a mock up for the homepage of my website, displaying specific form and visual elements of the website. Through exercising mock-ups, I have gained a better perspective of what my website will look like, and where I should still work on.
